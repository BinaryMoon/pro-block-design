# Pro Theme Blocks and Effects

New Blocks and Effects for the WordPress block editor. A complement to plugins like CoBlocks, and Atomic Blocks.

## Development Philosophy

* **Decisions not options**
* **Elegant simplicity** - for user experience AND code
* **Designed for speed** - front-end javascript and css should be as small as possible and not require libraries
* **Built in public** - all conversations and decisions should be documented on Github. If there are conversations in private, then a summary should be added to Github. Decisions should be transparent.

The code should:

* Use [WordPress coding standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)
* Enhance core functionality before building new things
* Should use modern development standards such as CSS custom properties.
